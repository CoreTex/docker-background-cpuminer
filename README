This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Litecoin and Bitcoin that runs as docker with niceness in the background to fill-up your cpu resources. Niceness of the process is set that it will not harm the performance your other docker containers.

Yes, it's uneffective but treat it as bitcoin lottery :)
